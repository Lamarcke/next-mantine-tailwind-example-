# next-starter
This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/docs) app scaffolded with `create-next-app`, which includes [Mantine]() and [TailwindCSS]() for components and styling.  


The file `src/app/pages.tsx` is copied from [next-mantine-tailwind-example](https://github.com/nerkarso/next-mantine-tailwind-example), which uses an older way of making Mantine (6.x.x) compatible with TailwindCSS.

## Getting Started
First, install the dependencies:
```bash
yarn
```
Then, start the development server:
```bash
yarn dev
```


Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `src/app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
